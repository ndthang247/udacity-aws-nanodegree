1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage: 60 seconds
If there is a planned or an unplanned outage for a Multi-AZ DB instance, Amazon RDS automatically switches to a standby replica or secondary instance in another Availability Zone. Depending on your database activity at the time of the time of the outage, failover usually lasts between 60-120 seconds'

2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage: 15 mins
in the event single region outage, we need a support staff manually promote the read replica in the secondary region to the primary db, update the app DB connection string to the new one. 
5-10 min to login AWS console
10-20 mins to fix the issue
=> total times: 15-30 mins

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage: 0 mins
beccause we already have a synchronous standby copy of the primary database so that we cannot loss data

4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage: 0 mins
because we already have a read replica in another region, so that we cannot loss data
