# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
  - Move web service EC2 instance into the private subnet
  - Redirect http requests to https in ALB
# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
Someone who has access to the attack instance can still access those S3 buckets
# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No, encryption will be applied to new uploads only. To encrypt existing files, they must be re-uploaded.
# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
All the manual changes would be reset.
